\noindent\textbf{Assignment 1, Due Friday Feb 4, 1:00PM.}
\vskip.15in

In class, we reviewed series and were introduced to power series. 

\begin{questions}
\question[5] $e^x$
\begin{parts}
  \part Find the series expansion
  \part Find the region of convergence
\end{parts}
\question[5] $\ln(1+x)$
\begin{parts}
  \part Find the series expansion
  \part Find the region of convergence
\end{parts}
\question[5] $(1+x)^p$
\begin{parts}
  \part Find the series expansion
  \part Find the region of convergence
\end{parts}
\question[5]
  What is the small angle approximation? Knowing what you know
about the topics we've covered in this class, how could you justify
the small angle approximation?

The main goal of the next part of the class is to get familiar with
the mechanics of working with series and complex numbers. So, this
assignment (like the next one) includes many short problems. The
selection below is a good one to get you acquainted with the
techniques. The starred problems are the ones you're required to turn
in, but the others are useful to test your knowledge.  \vskip.15in

\question[5] These three: \S1.10: 1*,2*,3,4,5; \S1.12: 1*

\question[5] These three: \S1.13: 5ab, 7ab*, 9ab, 10ab, 20*; \S1.14: 3* 
\end{questions}
