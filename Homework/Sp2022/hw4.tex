\vskip.1in \textbf{Legendre Problem 3} The Legendre polynomial $P_n(x)$ is
defined as the polynomial solution of the Legendre equation with
$\alpha=n$ that also satisfies the condition
$P_n(1)=1$.\\  

\textbf{(a)} Using the results of Problem 2, find the
first five Legendre polynomials, $P_0(x),...,P_5(x)$. \\  

\textbf{(b)}
Plot the graphs of $P_0(x),...,P_5(x)$ in the range for which we've
demonstrated convergence, $|x|\le1$. You can check your answers with
Wolfram Alpha (e.g. go to wolframalpha.com and type 
``plot 0.5*(3x\verb|^|2-1) from -1 to
1'' in the box), but you need to print out solutions here using Python
+ matplotlib. For this, please refer to the in-class notebooks and ask
your instructor/classmates for help early and often!\\

\textbf{(c)} Find the zeros of $P_0(x),...,P_5(x)$.

\textbf{Legendre Problem 4} The Legendre polynomials play an important role in
mathematical physics. For example, solving the potential equation
(Laplace's equation) in spherical coordinates, we encounter the
equation 


\begin{equation*}
  \dd{F(\phi)}{\phi} + \cot\phi\fd{F(\phi)}{\phi} + n(n+1)F(\phi) = 0,\qquad 0 < \phi < \pi
\end{equation*}

Show that the change of variables $x=\cos\phi$ leads to the Legendre
equation with $\alpha=n$ for $y=f(x)=F(\cos^{-1}(x))$ 

Hint: you may need to use the fact that


\begin{equation*}
  \sin(\arccos(x)) = \sqrt{1-x^2};\qquad \cot(\arccos(x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Legendre Problem 5} Show that the Legendre equation can also be written as

\begin{equation*}
  [(1-x^2)y']' = -\alpha(\alpha+1)y
\end{equation*}

It then follows that

\begin{equation}
  \label{e1}
  [(1-x^2)P_n^{'}(x)]' = -n(n+1)P_n(x)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{e2}
  [(1-x^2)P_m^{'}(x)]' = -m(m+1)P_m(x).
\end{equation}
By multiplying \eqref{e1} by $P_m(x)$ and \eqref{e2} by $P_n(x)$,
\textbf{integrating by parts}, and then subtracting one equation from the
other, show that


\begin{equation}
  \label{orth}
  \int_{-1}^{1}P_n(x)P_m(x)dx = 0 \qquad \mathrm{if} \quad n \ne m
\end{equation}

This property \eqref{orth} of the Legendre polynomials is known as the
orthogonality property. If $m=n$, it can be shown that the value of
the integral in \eqref{orth} is $2/(2n+1)$. 

\vskip.1in
Given a polynomial $f$ of degree $n$, it is possible to express $f$ as a linear combination of $P_0,P_1,...,P_n$:

\begin{equation}
  \label{basis}
  f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_kP_k(x)
\end{equation}

Note that, since the $n+1$ polynomials $P_0,...,P_n$ are linearly
independent, and the degree of $P_k$ is $k$, any polynomial of degree
$n$ can be expressed as \eqref{basis}. \\ Using the result of Problem
7, you can show that 


\begin{equation*}
  a_k=\frac{2k+1}{2}\int_{-1}^1f(x)P_k(x)dx
\end{equation*}

\textbf{but you don't have to! You're done!}
