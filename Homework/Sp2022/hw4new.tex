\section{Regarding the Method of Frobenius.}

Solving problems the Boas way:

Boas 12.11.8

\section{Boas \S7.2 Wave Review}
Make sure you understand the following problems

1, 6, 7, 17, 21. 

\section{Boas \S7.4 Average Value}
(Boas \S7.4, Problems \#3, 4, 10, 14) These should also be relatively fast.
\subsection{} 
Find the average value of the function on the given interval. You may
use equation 4.8 if it applies. It's well worth your time to make a
quick sketch of the function, as you may be able to quickly see if the
average value is zero.
\begin{equation}
  \sin x + 2\sin 2x + 3\sin 3x \qquad \textrm{on} \quad (0,2\pi)
\end{equation}

\subsection{}
\begin{equation}
  1 - e^{-x} \qquad \textrm{on} \quad (0,1)
\end{equation}

\subsection{}
\begin{equation}
  \cos x \qquad \textrm{on} \quad (0,3\pi)
\end{equation}

\subsection{}
Read through Problem 13. If the result doesn't seem obvious to you,
you may prove it and I'll grade it for extra credit. Use the result of
Problem 13 to evaluate the following integral without doing any calculation.
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{4\pi/3}\sin^2\left(\frac{3x}{2}\right) dx
\end{equation}

\section{Boas \S7.5 Fourier Series}

9 (graph the sum of the first four non-zero terms using Python in
addition to solving), 12, 13
