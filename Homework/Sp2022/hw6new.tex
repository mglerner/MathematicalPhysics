\section{Convolution}
Pick two functions of your own choice,
calculate the convolution, graph both functions and the convolution,
explain whether it makes sense graphically.

\subsection{Directional Derivative and Gradient}
Boas \S 6.6 \# 1, 2, 5

\subsection{Computational}
It's been a while since we did a computer exercise. My mistake! We can
use python to calculate gradients (and people often do). Google around
a bit and figure out at least one function that might do that.

You might find the numpy builtin function
(\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html}). You
might find another one.

Turn in a Jupyter notebook where you reproduce the example from the
documentation, explain what was calculated, and then do a similar
calculation (e.g. plug in some different values or some different
function), and explain if the result is what you expected.

\textbf{Turn in your Jupyter Notebook on Moodle}
