\section{The wave equation}
\subsection{Additional problem} Argue that the wave equation is a
reasonable physical model for waves. You may make this argument for
1D, 2D, or 3D waves. Does it seem reasonable for both longitudinal and
transverse waves? You may use the book, the internet, or whatever
resources you'd like, but make sure to cite your sources. Your
argument should be motivated from \textit{physical} considerations,
not just mathematical ones. If you answered this with a physical
argument last time, feel free to repeat that artument.

\section{Diffusion/Heat Flow; Schrodinger}
\subsection{Boas \S13.2} 13.2.3, 13.2.7
\subsection{Boas \S13.3} 13.3.1; you must also write down the rest of
the answer to Example 1. It's perfectly fine to use the book as a
reference *before* you write you answer, but I want you to write it
out in your final form without looking at the book.

\section{Steady State Temp in a Rectangular Plate}
\subsection{Additional problem} Most of the problems we've been solving involve an infinite number of terms in the solution. With appropriate boundary conditions, this is not required. Solve the semi-infinite rectangular plate problem with one side of the plate held at

\begin{equation}
  T = \sin\left(\frac{-2\pi x}{L}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{3\pi x}{L}\right)
\end{equation}

How many terms do you find in your solution, a finite number, or an
infinite number? 

If it's finite, why should that be true conceptually? How could you
change the initial conditions so that there were an infinite number of terms?

If it's infinite, why should that be true conceptually? How could you
