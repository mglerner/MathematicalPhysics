\section{Extending our work on the plucked string}
In class, we looked at the plucked, vibrating string. Now we want to
know what happens if, rather than plucking the string from the middle,
we pluck it near one side. Solve Chapter 13, section 4, problems 2 and
3. Compare the \textbf{sound} you would hear in the problem we solved
in class vs. these solutions (you may want to reference Chapter 7
section 10, but the basic idea is to look at the coefficients). Plot
the results in an IPython notebook (feel encouraged to steal code from
the notebook we used in class), and comment on whether they look like
what you'd expect at first, and at some large time in the
future. Compare those plots to your answer about sound.
