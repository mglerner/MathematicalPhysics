\noindent\textbf{Assignment 2, Due Wednesday Feb 10, 5:00 PM.}
\vskip.15in


The main goal of this part of the class is to get familiar with the
mechanics of working with series and complex numbers. So, this
assignment includes many short problems. The selection below is a good
one to get you acquainted with the techniques. The starred problems
are the ones you're required to turn in (there are four of them).

\noindent \S1.15: 33* \\
\S2.4: 1*,2,3*,11*,12,13 \\

As you know, there's an exam coming up covering complex numbers. I
won't cover logs on the exam, but I will cover things like complex
powers, geometric representations, and trig functions. So, the
following (short) problems are due.

\noindent \S2.5 51\\
\S2.7 9 \\
\S2.9 1, 5, 12 \\
\S 2.10 16, 17, 20\\
