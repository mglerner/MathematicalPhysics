\section{Boas \S7.8 Other Intervals}

Do problem 7.8.9. Compare it with 7.5.9 from before.

\section{Boas \S7.9 Even and Odd functions}

The example that starts on page 367 is excellent. It shows expanding a
given function as a Fourier sine series, a Fourier cosine series, and
a Fourier series (that last one is typically taken to mean that you
have both sine and cosine terms, or that you use the complex
exponential version of Fourier series).

\subsection{} Read through that example, and then do
problem \S7.9.15. Please note that Boas gives you the answer so that
you can check your work!


Expand $\sin(x)$ in a
$\cos$ series, or $\cos(x)$ in a $\sin$ series.

Also do 7.9.6, 7.9.23, and 7.9.24.
