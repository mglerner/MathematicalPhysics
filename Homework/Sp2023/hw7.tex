\noindent\textbf{Assignment 7, Due Monday April 3rd}
\vskip.15in

\subsection{Directional Derivative and Gradient}
Boas \S 6.6 \# 1, 2, 5

\subsection{Line Integrals -- Due Monday when you return}
Boas \S 6.8 (Line integrals) \#
1, 6, 8

\subsection{Finishing our in-class problem - part 1} We evaluated a line
integral around several paths in class. Finish the parts we did not do
in class. MAKE SURE TO DO THIS BEFORE CLASS ON MONDAY!

%Use the parabola as the bottom
%of a region, and the edges of the rectangle as the left side and top
%fo the region, and explicitly verify Green's Theorem for the field
%discussed in class.

\section{The wave equation}
Argue that the wave equation\footnote{What is the wave equation? Look
  in Boas Ch. 13, or on the internet!} is a reasonable physical model for
waves. You may make this argument for 1D, 2D, or 3D waves. Does it
seem reasonable for both longitudinal and transverse waves? You may
use the book, the internet, or whatever resources you'd like, but make
sure to \textit{cite your sources}.
