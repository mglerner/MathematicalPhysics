\section{It's all Multivariable Calculus this time}
\subsection{Conceptual Understanding}
In the style of Fenyman, and including pictures, write out a proof of
either the divergence theorem or Stokes' theorem. You're free to spend
as much time studying Feynman as you like \textit{before} doing this
problem. But, while you're writing it out, you must put away all
references. You can re-do the problem until you've completed it fully
in a ``closed-notes'' fashion.

\subsection{Green's theorem in the plane}
Boas starts out with Green's theorem in the plane. Look at her
section. Explain how one can derive that from what we covered in
Feynman.

\subsection{Divergence and Curl}
Write up your solutions for all six parts of the worksheet we did in class.
