\section{Fourier Transforms}

\section{Deltas}
Boas section 8.11 number 20 (only need to verify 11.19 parts d and e)
and number 21.

\section{Convolution}
Pick two functions of your own choice,
calculate the convolution, graph both functions and the convolution,
explain whether it makes sense graphically.

\subsection{Computational}
It's been a while since we did a computer exercise. My mistake! We can
use python to calculate gradients (and people often do). Google around
a bit and figure out at least one function that might do that.

You might find the numpy builtin function
(\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html}). You
might find another one.

Turn in a Jupyter notebook where you reproduce the example from the
documentation, explain what was calculated, and then do a similar
calculation (e.g. plug in some different values or some different
function), and explain if the result is what you expected.
