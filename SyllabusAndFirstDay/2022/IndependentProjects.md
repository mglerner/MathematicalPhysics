# More information about your independent projects

The primary goals of this course are involve developing a level of mathematical sophistication that will allow you to confidently and competently explore further material outside of a lecture setting. So, in order to make sure we're walking the walk, you'll each pick either an interesting problem to model or an interesting technique to learn. You'll write a short paper and present the results to the class. You'll be expected to start on this halfway through the semester, and we'll discuss it in more detail at that point. Examples might include

* The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
* Physical representations of Fourier Transforms, including circuits and optics
* The discrete Fourier Transform, including application to time series data, consideration of how many useful samples you have in a dataset in space, etc.
* Struve functions
* Complex analysis including itegrating around poles, Cauchy Integral, Residue theorem [**Note** this one is hard to in terms of picking an actual project; you'll need to talk to me early and often.]
* Tensors, covariant vs. contravariant, pseudo-vectors, index notation
* Black-Scholes Theorem (economics)
* Applications of Noether's Theorem to economic systems
* Modern techniques such as the immersed-boundary method
* Coding and examination of more complex numerical integrators
* Green-Kubo relations and the Fluctuation Theorem
* Wavelet Transforms
* Real world applications of any of the techniques studied in this course
* Interesting topic of your choice!

# What does each project consist of?

Part of the purpose of this class (and many others) is scientific communication. You're going to pick something really interesting, so I want to make sure you get to present it both to me and to the class. It's also important to do something *new*. That's part of what makes this research, and part of how you know you understand things. Examples of "new" from the past have included:

* For the Black-Scholes, someone took stock market data from when they started the project, predicted the price of a particular stock on the last day of the term, and then looked at the actual price.
* For the FFT, you might record someone trying to sing a pure tone, and see if you can understand the results

So, your paper will include an explanation of the new math and physics you learned. Your **audience** is someone else in the class.

Most of you will probably include computer code to reproduce your results.

# How long should the paper be? What format?

You should shoot for around 10 pages, including words, math, and pictures. That doesn't include code, because code can be really long in comparison. You don't have to hit 10 pages precisely, but I'v never seen a great paper for this assignment that was under 5 pages, or over 20 pages (and I've seen both extremes).

# What format should I use?

I prefer that you turn in code in the form of Jupyter notebooks, but we can talk if you'd rather do something else.

For the paper itself, you can turn in a Word document, a PDF or (my preference) an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) link.

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) lets you format equations, words, and pictures nicely. It's the professional standard in many fields, and it's (in my opinion) way easier once you start having a lot of equations. There are a lot of [tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/help/category/video_tutorials) to help you if you need help, but you can get pretty far by just starting to type. If you don't have a lot of experience writing equations in LaTeX (i.e. most of us), check out the awesome [codecogs equation editor](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php). If you write your paper in Overleaf, you can either send me the PDF or just the URL.

You should include a bibliography with references. I don't particularly care which citation style you use, as long as you're consistent. If you need help getting a bibliography to work on Overleaf, check out the [tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/help/category/video_tutorials) I mentioned before!

# How formal does it need to be?

Relatively informal is fine. I prefer the LaTeX defaults. If you're writing in Word, I prefer 1.25x spacing.

# What about that video you mentioned?

When the class is small, everybody does 30 minute presentations. When it's large, everybody makes YouTube videos. You can check out cameras from the CST desk, or use your cell phones. I'll post a private chanel that we can upload to. Then, you'll be responsible for watching at least three other videos and offering questions and comments. I want 5 minute videos, which means that I won't grade anything under 4 minutes or over 6.
